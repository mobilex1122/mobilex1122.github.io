## Intro

Hi! This is my attempt to clone my [main site](https://mobilex1122.eu) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) system.

## How did it go?

Well at start I didn't know how to use this thing but after a while It clicked and **WOW!** I's really easy to make stuff in this. Posts can be planned and everything is markdown based (you can use html if needed). For example to make a new post make a file in `_posts` named: `YYYY-MM-DD-posturl.md` and then add this boilerplate:

```md
---
layout: "post"
title: Post title
author: YOU!
---

Post text here
```

and for pages it's basicaly same without the date in the name and they are placed in the root of the project (`/index.md` or `blog/index.html`)
